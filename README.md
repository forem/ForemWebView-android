# ForemWebView-android üíù

This is the official repository for the ForemWebView-android library which is used in [Forem Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.forem.android)


## Design ethos

ForemWebView-android is a [WebView](https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview) based library designed specifically keeping in mind the [Forem Android App](https://github.com/forem/forem-android). This library can be used by an other app to use instance of a [forem](https://forem.com/) in their own android app.


## Setting up the library

### Gradle Setup

1. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
allprojects {
  repositories {
   ...
   maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

2. Add the dependency
```
  implementation 'com.github.forem:ForemWebView-android:${latest_release}'
```

### Maven Setup
1. Adding jitpack

```
<repositories>
  <repository>
   <id>jitpack.io</id>
   <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

2. Add the dependency
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.forem</groupId>
  <artifactId>ForemWebView-android</artifactId>
  <version>{latest_release}</version>
</dependency>
```
